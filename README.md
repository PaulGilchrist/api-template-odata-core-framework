# odata-core-template
### REST API Template using OData, OpenAPI, and OAuth

Demo and training application showing OAuth, OData, and Swashbuckle (Swagger 3 / Open API) working together on ASP.Net Core 2.1+

You can find steps on how to recreate this project from scratch at [GitHub Document Library](https://github.com/PaulGilchrist/documents)

### Feature Details

* OData is working, as is Swagger, but Swagger is only showing standard non-odata controllers
* Need to add support for OAuth bearer tokens
